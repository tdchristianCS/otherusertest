# YOUR TASK IS...

# Create a dictionary of people in the class (p.s. I've attached a starter)
# Choose any quality for them, and map their name to that quality

CLASS = {
    'Meagan': 'Female',
    'Matt': 'Male',
    'Sharon': 'Female'
}

# Then, adapt our code to invert this dictionary
# So that we have a new dictionary of qualities to names

GENDERS = {
    'Male': ['Matt'],
    'Female': ['Meagan', 'Sharon']
}

# Make this inversion a function
