Challenge: Write a password checker.

It must take in input from the user for a potential password.

You have to print whether it is a valid password or not.

A valid password...

-- Is it at least 8 characters long
-- Contains at least
		1 symbol
		1 uppercase letter
		1 lowercase letter
		1 number
-- Does not contain...
		Their birthday, which is '1991-12-05'
		Their pet's name, which is 'Fido'

Hint: Could you make a function for each of those three things,
plus a fourth function that runs the other three?
